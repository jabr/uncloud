## Uncloud extensions

Uncloud provides several custom extensions to enhance the Compose experience:

### `x-ports`

Expose HTTP/HTTPS service ports via the Caddy reverse proxy, or bind TCP/UDP ports directly to the host:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    x-ports:
      - 80/https
      - example.com:80/https
      - 8080:80/tcp@host
```

See [Publishing services](../1-ingress/2-publishing-services.md) for more details.

### `x-caddy`

Custom Caddy reverse proxy configuration for a service:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    x-caddy: |
      example.com {
        reverse_proxy {{upstreams 80}}
      }
```

See [Publishing services](../1-ingress/2-publishing-services.md) for more details.

### `x-machines`

Restrict which machines can run your service. If you deploy multiple replicas, Uncloud automatically spreads them across
the specified machines.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    x-machines:
      - machine-1
      - machine-2
    # Short syntax for a single machine
    # x-machines: machine-1
```
